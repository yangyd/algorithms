# Algorithms

This repository contains [Groovy](http://groovy.apache.org) implementation of some of the algorithms discussed in the book [*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms). Note that the implementation does not necessarily follow examples or psudo codes given by the book.

New implementation and corresponding test cases will be added from time to time.

To run test cases, do `mvn test`.
